/* 
You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
So, you can iterate iver each stone to check if it is a jewel or not. This will take a complexity of O(N*M), where N=Number of jewels and M=number of stones.
Moreover, we can optimize it by storing all jewels in an array. This will reduce the complexity to O(M).
